# OpenDS-changes-for-self-driving

We are making several changes to the Java programs for OpenDS to allow self-driving of steering or user cars and access driving data from the moving obstacles in the simulation. Other changes include making the dashboard appropriate for US driving. Reporting center-line of the lane in which a the steering car is and so on.
